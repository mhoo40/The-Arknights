An unfinished arknights mod, inspired by 'the firewatch doujin?' expansion mod.
(Works best with Rekmod)

This mod contains (supposedly) multiple arkinghts's factions such as Rhodes Island, Reunion,...
Currently there are only 2 "nations", and RI's units have special skills while Reunion to me feel quite lackluster.

More nations might come if i have the time to do so.
So if you have any balance opinions, suggestions or bugs that need to be reported, you can go to the github pages.

Also, i can't change the default unit tilesets like scout,... So help me if you can:)
